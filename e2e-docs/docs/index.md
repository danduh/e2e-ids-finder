## Key Features

- **Element Scanning**: Automatically scan your web pages to identify elements based on a predefined attribute. This feature helps you quickly locate elements that will be used to generate page objects.
- **Customizable Prompts**: Define and manage both system and user prompts to tailor the AI's behavior to your specific testing needs. Customize the responses to ensure they align perfectly with your testing requirements.
- **Support for Shadow DOM**: Enable the inclusion of elements within Shadow DOM, allowing you to work with modern web components effortlessly.
- **Flexible AI Integration**: Choose from various AI instances, including OpenAI, LLaMA, and Azure AI. Configure the AI model, API endpoint, and other settings to match your development environment.
- **Efficient Page Object Generation**: Generate page objects with meaningful names and detailed prompts. The extension sends the HTML elements and your instructions to the AI, which returns a complete page object ready for use in your tests.
- **Easy Export Options**: Save the generated page objects as files or copy the code directly to your clipboard. This makes it easy to integrate the generated code into your existing codebase.

## How It Works

1. **Scan Elements**: Begin by scanning the web page to identify elements with the specified attribute.
2. **Define Page Object**: Provide a meaningful name for the page object and select or define prompts to guide the AI in generating the page object.
3. **Generate and Save**: Send the request to the AI and wait for the response. Once the page object is generated, you can save it as a file or copy the code.
